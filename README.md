So you won't have to do 200 photos of some shoes, I've included the latter in the folder 'Example Model Image'. These images are provided by apple and there are contained 123 images of some shoe. You can use this as the input directory.

# How does this work?
You select the directory where you've got your fancy photos, then you select another directory which serves as your output (to where the 3D model and other stuff will be exported to). Then you press on "Process images" and Apple handles there rest.

### Note that this process is somewhat heavy. So use the best Mac you've got or it'll take you ages. Apple suggests to use the Macs with their silicon neuro fancy process so it'll take as quickly as possible.
